  The use of new techniques to stimulate the learning of new technologies that have direct impact in peoples life is required. Studies show that kids immersed in learning environments supported by technology tools acquire higher accomplishments. The purpose of this project is to create a programmable robot that can stimulate kids in the age of 7 or above to develop concepts related to logical thinking. This robot will be programmable through block commands in an Android mobile app.
